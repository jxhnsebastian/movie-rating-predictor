# Movie Rating Predictor

The project consisted of exploratory data analysis, pre-processing, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation. During the exploratory analysis, the distribution and relationship between the features and target variable (Rating) were analyzed to gain a better understanding of the data. The findings from the exploratory analysis were used to inform the pre-processing steps, which involved scaling and encoding the data. The model selection process involved comparing the performance of Linear Regression, Decision Tress, Random Forests and Gradient Boosting learning algorithms and selecting the best performing model. Out of the four models Gradien Boosting gave the highest r2 score of 79.6%. The hyperparameter tuning process aimed at finding the optimal parameters for the model to improve its performance.
